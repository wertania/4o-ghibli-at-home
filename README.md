## Quick Start<a name="quick-start"></a>

### How Does It Work?<a name="how-does-it-work"></a>

- Modern web UI with custom style profiles, undo/redo, and advanced controls
 - Generation is handled remotely by `fal.ai` – no GPU required locally
- Images and jobs stored locally and cleaned up automatically
- All logging and queueing handled in-memory—no Redis, no Celery required
- **Linux only for now; works on both mobile and desktop. Windows support coming soon.**

### Requirements<a name="requirements"></a>

- **At this time, installation is supported exclusively on Linux.**

- **Python 3.11+**
  - `uv` (Python package installer)
- Internet connection to reach the `fal.ai` API
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
- Some images to Ghiblify!

### Setup Overview<a name="setup-overview"></a>

**I recommend using `uv`.** If you don't have `uv`, install it with `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`. You may need to restart your terminal.

**Here's the quick overview, details are explained further below:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheAhmadOsman/4o-ghibli-at-home.git
cd 4o-ghibli-at-home
uv venv .venv --python 3.12
source .venv/bin/activate
uv sync
cp .env_template .env             # configure as needed
python3.12 app.py                 # start the server
```

## Major Features<a name="major-features"></a>

This is not just a Ghibli-fier! The app has dozens of style profiles and advanced controls, you can transform your photos into everything from oil paintings and comic book art to cyberpunk cityscapes and vintage film stills. **Save your own custom styles, tweak the defaults, and use the app with _no login required_. Your images stay on your machine, always.**

- **Advanced Frontend**: A sophisticated, single-page application with:
  - Dozens of built-in **Style Profiles** organized by category (e.g., Animation, Artistic, Vintage).
  - **Custom Profile Management**: Save, load, and delete your own favorite settings.
  - **Undo/Redo** history for iterative editing.
  - Advanced controls for prompts, inference steps, guidance scales, and seeds.
- **fal.ai Integration**: Images are generated through the cloud-based `fal.ai` API, so no local model is required.
- **Lightweight Requirements**: There is no need for a dedicated GPU or large model downloads.
- **Environment-based Configuration**: Easily manage settings like queue size, file storage, and device selection using a `.env` file.
- **Persistent Storage & Cleanup**: Generated images are saved to disk, with an automatic background worker to clean up old job data and files to save space.
- **Intelligent Logging**: Uses `Loguru` for clean, readable logs and automatically filters out noisy status checks to keep the console tidy.
- **Simplified Architecture**: No external dependencies like Redis or Celery. Just Python and the required ML libraries.
- **Asynchronous Task Queue**: Uses a simple, thread-safe, in-memory queue to handle image generation jobs one by one, preventing server overload.

## Coming Up: Project Roadmap<a name="coming-up-project-roadmap"></a>

Here's a look at the features and improvements planned for the near future:

**High Priority:**

- **Expanded Model Support:**
  - **GGUF & Advanced Quantization:** Introduce support for GGUF model formats and automatically select the best quantization level based on detected hardware. This will significantly lower VRAM requirements and broaden hardware compatibility.
- ~~**`uv` Project Integration:** Fully transition the project to use `uv` for dependency and environment management, leveraging its speed.~~

**Core Enhancements:**

- **More Styling Profiles:** Add a new wave of creative and visual style presets to the frontend.
- **Windows Support:** Official installation and setup instructions for Windows users.
- **Dockerization:** Provide a `Dockerfile` for easy, one-command deployment in a containerized environment.

## Setup & Installation<a name="setup--installation"></a>

As mentioned above, **I recommend using `uv`.** If you don't have `uv`, install it with `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`. You may need to restart your terminal.

### 1. Clone the Project<a name="1-clone-the-project"></a>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheAhmadOsman/4o-ghibli-at-home.git
cd 4o-ghibli-at-home
```

### 2. Create and Activate a Python Virtual Environment<a name="2-create-and-activate-a-python-virtual-environment"></a>

A virtual environment is crucial for isolating project dependencies.

```bash
# Create the virtual environment using uv
uv venv .vemv --python 3.12
```

After creating the environment, activate it:

```bash
# Activate
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies<a name="3-install-dependencies"></a>

Install the Python dependencies from `pyproject.toml` into your activated environment.

```bash
# This command syncs your environment with the dependencies in pyproject.toml
uv sync
```

### 4. Configure Your Environment<a name="4-configure-your-environment"></a>

The application is configured using an environment file.

1. Rename `.env_template` to `.env` in the project's root directory.
2. Edit the contents of your new `.env` file and set your `FAL_KEY` and desired `FAL_APPLICATION`.

## How to Run<a name="how-to-run"></a>

The application runs with a single command, which starts the web server and the background processing worker. **I usually run local sessions with the development command.**

- **For Development (Recommended & Tested):**

  ```bash
  python3.12 app.py
  ```

- **For Production:**

  Use a production-grade WSGI server like Gunicorn. **It is critical to use only ONE worker** because the job queue is in-memory and cannot be shared across multiple processes.

  First, install the production dependencies:

  ```bash
  uv sync --group prod
  ```

  Then, run the server:

  ```bash
  # The `--workers 1` flag is essential for this application's design.
  # Increase --threads for more concurrent I/O, and --timeout for long-running jobs.
  gunicorn --workers 1 --threads 4 --timeout 600 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app
  ```

### App Options<a name="app-options"></a>

You can customize the server port by using the `--port` option when starting the app. For example, to run the server on port 5555:

```bash
python3.12 app.py --port 5555
```

By default, the application runs on port 5000 if no `--port` argument is provided.

## Open the App<a name="open-the-app"></a>

Once the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to:

**<http://127.0.0.1:5000>**

You can now upload an image and start stylizing!

## API Endpoints<a name="api-endpoints"></a>

- `POST /process-image` — Submits an image processing job. Returns a `job_id`.
- `GET /status/<job_id>` — Checks the status of a job (`queued`, `processing`, `completed`, `failed`). Returns `queue_position` if queued.
- `GET /result/<job_id>` — If the job is `completed`, returns the generated PNG image from the disk.

## Project Structure<a name="project-structure"></a>

- `app.py` — The all-in-one Flask server, API endpoints, and background image processing workers.
- `pyproject.toml` — Project metadata and dependencies.
- `static/*` — The complete, dynamic frontend application.
- `generated_images/` — (Default directory) Where generated images are stored.
- `.env` — (User-created from `.env_template`) File for all your local configuration.

## Deployment / Production Checklist<a name="deployment--production-checklist"></a>

- [ ] Create and configure your `.env` file on the production server.
- [ ] Update `CORS(app)` in `app.py` to a specific origin for your frontend domain if it's hosted separately.
- [ ] **Crucially, run with a single worker process (e.g., `gunicorn --workers 1`)** due to the in-memory queue design.
- [ ] Use a reverse proxy like Nginx or Apache in front of the application for SSL/TLS, caching, and rate limiting.
- [ ] Set up log rotation for the output from your WSGI server.
- [ ] Set up monitoring to watch server health and resource usage (CPU, GPU, RAM).
- [ ] (Optional) Add an authentication layer for private deployments.
